This repo defines a docker image that can build a running RT to use
for testing Request Tracker (RT) extensions.

It is intended only for testing but might be used as a base example for
other deployments of RT with docker. Since it is used for testing, it
includes development dependencies that are not needed for production RT deployments.

Thanks to Christian Loos (GitHub:@cloos) for publishing RT docker examples.
