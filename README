This repo defines a docker image that can build a running RT to use
for testing Request Tracker (RT) extensions.

It is intended only for testing but might be used as a base example for
other deployments of RT with docker. Since it is used for testing, it
includes development dependencies that are not needed for production RT deployments.

Thanks to Christian Loos (GitHub:@cloos) for publishing RT docker examples.

To build the image:

docker build -t rt5-stretch .

To run the application in docker :

docker run --name rt5 --link mariadb:db --hostname rt5docker.local -p 5800:80 rt5-stretch

The dockerfile exposes port 80 by default, you can change the mapped port as required.
The docker image uses the hostname provided to set the RT configuration, so that you can add
 it to /etc/hosts on the host machine and proxy it, allowing you to access it as http://rt5docker.local/
 or other specified hostname directly in the browser
